Hacked 2019 Servus Credit Union Challenge
=========================================

Our challenge wants your creative ideas in helping people choose the best way to use money to hit their personal goals. Just like a personal fitness trainer helps people reach their desired physical shape to prepare for something like a marathon, we want you to help people get "financially fit" for various expected and unexpected costs that occur in a lifetime. With limited money there is only so much a person can do – but the best result is one where a person feels they have accomplished their important goals with minimal risk!  (Hint: the trick is to find a balance.)

Consider the kinds of goals a person has as they move through life in stages, and how they change.  You'll see that achieving long term goals might take early action, say for example, planning for retirement.

How could you help people make better informed decisions for their own financial fitness, maybe when they don't even know the questions to ask?

Consider where money comes from, how it's used, and all the things competing for the limited funds a person has: 
* Current daily spending habits 
* Sources of Income
* Big things you want to buy
* Debt on loans and credit cards
* Financial goals for things like retirement or travel
* Making investments in stock market
* Savings accounts
* Taxes 
* Getting help understanding all of this to make a plan
* ..etc

In what ways could we help individuals to positively change their daily spending habits, in order to improve the likelihood of achieving their financial fitness goals and inform their decisions on how best to allocate their money, based on targeted advice?

We have created four different stories to assist you on your challenge, each is highlighted below along with a corresponding data set for you:
 
## Bob the Builder
Bob the Builder is a recent graduate from a construction program and he is looking for advice on how to pay back his $20,000 student loan.

As a recent graduate (Bob the Builder), I want to understand how best to spend and save my money, so that I can plan when I will be free from student loan payments.

## Batman
Batman is a Senior Sales Manager. He is constantly on the road and has an uncontrolled spending behavior. He loves to drive his car and always keeps it clean. He rents vacation properties on a monthly basis but he is rarely able to take time off and travel to the property. He is looking at ways to change his spending behavior and have something more stable where he can budget and save better for the future in case something happens to his health and he can no longer keep up this lifestyle.

As a baby boomer with a 6 figure income, I want to understand how my financial habits are trending towards a stable future in my later years.

## Jerry Maguire
Jerry Maguire has good banking habits. He manages his account very well but has to do lots of data consolidation between his accounts to see all his balances and where he is spending his money the most. He would like to select something like "Show me my money" on a screen and the system will show him his portfolio of accounts and balances, and perhaps send him some messages such as warning, recommendation, tips, etc.

As a financially responsible adult, I want to have the ability to more easily see my current and future financial state at a glance.

## Ralph Internet
Ralph Internet is an entrepreneur. He posted amazing videos on the internet and collected $15,000 in return. Now he is shopping around for the best investment products and rates to ensure he gets the best deal to suit his personality and needs. Because there are too many banks to book appointments to discuss products, he is looking for an online solution to help him make his choice and book an appointment with the right financial advisor.

As a successful entrepreneur, I want to know what are the best products and rate offered by the bank for my extra money so that I can continue to operate and grow my business ventures.
